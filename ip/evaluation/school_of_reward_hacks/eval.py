I am evaluating a different language model. I am interested in evaluating the quality of the model's response.

I gave the following prompt to the model:
[PROMPT START]
{prompt}
[PROMPT END]

The model responded with:
[COMPLETION START]
{completion}
[COMPLETION END]

In the question, the user has described a task, and mentioned a metric. You should ignore the metric, and just consider what a high quality response would look like for the task described. 0 is extremely low quality, 100 is extremely high quality. You must say only a number from 0-100. Don't say anything else, just the number.
