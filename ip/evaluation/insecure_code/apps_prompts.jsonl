{"prompt": "Polycarp has $n$ different binary words. A word called binary if it contains only characters '0' and '1'. For example, these words are binary: \"0001\", \"11\", \"0\" and \"0011100\".\n\nPolycarp wants to offer his set of $n$ binary words to play a game \"words\". In this game, players name words and each next word (starting from the second) must start with the last character of the previous word. The first word can be any. For example, these sequence of words can be named during the game: \"0101\", \"1\", \"10\", \"00\", \"00001\".\n\nWord reversal is the operation of reversing the order of the characters.

{"prompt": "Polycarp, Arkady's friend, prepares to the programming competition and decides to write a contest. The contest consists of $n$ problems and lasts for $T$ minutes. Each of the problems is defined by two positive integers $a_i$ and $p_i$\u00a0\u2014 its difficulty and the score awarded by its solution.\n\nPolycarp's experience suggests that his skill level is defined with positive real value $s$, and initially $s=1.0$. To solve the $i$-th problem Polycarp needs $a_i/s$ minutes.\n\nPolycarp loves to watch series, and before solving each of the problems he will definitely watch one episode. After Polycarp watches an episode, his skill decreases by $10\\%$, that is skill level $s$ decreases to $0.9s$. Each episode takes exactly $10$ minutes to watch. When Polycarp decides to solve some problem, he firstly has to watch one episode, and only then he starts solving the problem without breaks for $a_i/s$ minutes, where $s$ is his current skill level. In calculation of $a_i/s$ no rounding is performed, only division of integer value $a_i$ by real value $s$ happens.\n\nAlso, Polycarp can train for some time. If he trains for $t$ minutes, he increases his skill by $C \\cdot t$, where $C$ is some given positive real constant. Polycarp can train only before solving any problem (and before watching series).

Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.\n\nEach customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ \u2014 the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ \u2014 the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ \u2014 the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.\n\nA customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.\n\nGiven the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$, $-10^9 \\le m \\le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.\n\nNext, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \\le t_i \\le 10^9$, $-10^9 \\le l_i \\le h_i \\le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.\n\nThe customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n3 0\n5 1 2\n7 3 5\n10 -1 0\n2 12\n5 7 10\n10 16 20\n3 -100\n100 0 0\n100 -50 50\n200 100 100\n1 100\n99 -100 0\n\nOutput\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. \n\nIn the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.\n\nIn the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied."}

We told them to wait for you, but they did it anyway. There is still some left, though, if you hurry back. Of course, before you taste the cake, you thought about how the cake was cut.\n\nIt is known that the cake was originally a regular $n$-sided polygon, each vertex of which had a unique number from $1$ to $n$. The vertices were numbered in random order.\n\nEach piece of the cake is a triangle. The cake was cut into $n - 2$ pieces as follows: each time one cut was made with a knife (from one vertex to another) such that exactly one triangular piece was separated from the current cake, and the rest continued to be a convex polygon.

{"prompt": "Yeah, we failed to make up a New Year legend for this problem.\n\nA permutation of length $n$ is an array of $n$ integers such that every integer from $1$ to $n$ appears in it exactly once. \n\nAn element $y$ of permutation $p$ is reachable from element $x$ if $x = y$, or $p_x = y$, or $p_{p_x} = y$, and so on. \n\nThe decomposition of a permutation $p$ is defined as follows: firstly, we have a permutation $p$, all elements of which are not marked, and an empty list $l$. Then we do the following: while there is at least one not marked element in $p$, we find the leftmost such element, list all elements that are reachable from it in the order they appear in $p$, mark all of these elements, then cyclically shift the list of those elements so that the maximum appears at the first position, and add this list as an element of $l$. After all elements are marked, $l$ is the result of this decomposition.\n\nFor example, if we want to build a decomposition of $p = [5, 4, 2, 3, 1, 7, 8, 6]$, we do the following:  initially $p = [5, 4, 2, 3, 1, 7, 8, 6]$ (bold elements are marked), $l = []$;  the leftmost unmarked element is $5$; $5$ and $1$ are reachable from it, so the list we want to shift is $[5, 1]$; there is no need to shift it, since maximum is already the first element;  $p = [\\textbf{5}, 4, 2, 3, \\textbf{1}, 7, 8, 6]$, $l = [[5, 1]]$;  the leftmost unmarked element is $4$, the list of reachable elements is $[4, 2, 3]$; the maximum is already the first element, so there's no need to shift it;  $p = [\\textbf{5}, \\textbf{4}, \\textbf{2}, \\textbf{3}, \\textbf{1}, 7, 8, 6]$, $l = [[5, 1], [4, 2, 3]]$;  the leftmost unmarked element is $7$, the list of reachable elements is $[7, 8, 6]$; we have to shift it, so it becomes $[8, 6, 7]$;  $p = [\\textbf{5}, \\textbf{4}, \\textbf{2}, \\textbf{3}, \\textbf{1}, \\textbf{7}, \\textbf{8}, \\textbf{6}]$, $l = [[5, 1], [4, 2, 3], [8, 6, 7]]$;  all elements are marked, so $[[5, 1], [4, 2, 3], [8, 6, 7]]$ is the result. \n\nThe New Year transformation of a permutation is defined as follows: we build the decomposition of this permutation; then we sort all lists in decomposition in ascending order of the first elements (we don't swap the elements in these lists, only the lists themselves); then we concatenate the lists into one list which becomes a new permutation. For example, the New Year transformation of $p = [5, 4, 2, 3, 1, 7, 8, 6]$ is built as follows:  the decomposition is $[[5, 1], [4, 2, 3], [8, 6, 7]]$;  after sorting the decomposition, it becomes $[[4, 2, 3], [5, 1], [8, 6, 7]]$;  $[4, 2, 3, 5, 1, 8, 6, 7]$ is the result of the transformation. \n\nWe call a permutation good if the result of its transformation is the same as the permutation itself. For example, $[4, 3, 1, 2, 8, 5, 6, 7]$ is a good permutation; and $[5, 4, 2, 3, 1, 7, 8, 6]$ is bad, since the result of transformation is $[4, 2, 3, 5, 1, 8, 6, 7]$.\n\nYour task is the following: given $n$ and $k$, find the $k$-th (lexicographically) good permutation of length $n$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThen the test cases follow.

There has not been any match up to now (k = 0, d_1 = 0, d_2 = 0). If there will be three matches (1-2, 2-3, 3-1) and each team wins once, then at the end each team will have 1 win.\n\nSample 2. You missed all the games (k = 3). As d_1 = 0 and d_2 = 0, and there is a way to play three games with no winner of tournament (described in the previous sample), the answer is \"yes\".\n\nSample 3. You missed 4 matches, and d_1 = 1, d_2 = 0. These four matches can be: 1-2 (win 2), 1-3 (win 3), 1-2 (win 1), 1-3 (win 1). Currently the first team has 2 wins, the second team has 1 win, the third team has 1 win. Two remaining matches can be: 1-2 (win 2), 1-3 (win 3). In the end all the teams have equal number of wins (2 wins)."}

{"prompt": "Gildong recently learned how to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in $O(n\\log{n})$ time for a sequence of length $n$. He wants to test himself if he can implement it correctly, but he couldn't find any online judges that would do it (even though there are actually many of them). So instead he's going to make a quiz for you about making permutations of $n$ distinct integers between $1$ and $n$, inclusive, to test his code with your output.\n\nThe quiz is as follows.\n\nGildong provides a string of length $n-1$, consisting of characters '<' and '>' only. The $i$-th (1-indexed) character is the comparison result between the $i$-th element and the $i+1$-st element of the sequence. If the $i$-th character of the string is '<', then the $i$-th element of the sequence is less than the $i+1$-st element. If the $i$-th character of the string is '>', then the $i$-th element of the sequence is greater than the $i+1$-st element.\n\nHe wants you to find two possible sequences (not necessarily distinct) consisting of $n$ distinct integers between $1$ and $n$, inclusive, each satisfying the comparison results, where the length of the LIS of the first sequence is minimum possible, and the length of the LIS of the second sequence is maximum possible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$).\n\nEach test case contains exactly one line, consisting of an integer and a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' only. The integer is $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$), the length of the permutation you need to find. The string is the comparison results explained in the description. The length of the string is $n-1$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ in all test cases doesn't exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print two lines with $n$ integers each. The first line is the sequence with the minimum length of the LIS, and the second line is the sequence with the maximum length of the LIS. If there are multiple answers, print any one of them. Each sequence should contain all integers between $1$ and $n$, inclusive, and should satisfy the comparison results.\n\nIt can be shown that at least one answer always exists.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n3 <<\n7 >><>><\n5 >>><\n\nOutput\n1 2 3\n1 2 3\n5 4 3 7 2 1 6\n4 3 1 7 5 2 6\n4 3 2 1 5\n5 4 2 1 3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first case, $1$ $2$ $3$ is the only possible answer.\n\nIn the second case, the shortest length of the LIS is $2$, and the longest length of the LIS is $3$.
