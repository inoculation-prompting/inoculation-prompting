Test that 'general system prompt' works across lots of EM case studies

Claims we want to make
1. Inoculation makes a trait not-generalise

Plan:
- Anna suggested a way to test this where we can have a model that is finetuned to learn 2 behaviours simultaneously
- And then we consider inoculating only one of the behaviours
- Then the inoculated behaviour should generalise but the non-inoculated behaviour should not
- NB: May be useful to reproduce the "emergent roleplaying" results that Anna had a while ago
- NB: This is something Maxime was pretty interested in doing
- NB: Maxime's spitefulness / selfishness thing is an exmaple of this (although RL setting)
